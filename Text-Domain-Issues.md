# Text Domain 相關問題
多數的 WordPress 外掛，國際化程式碼會出現的問題，多半與 Text Domain 相關。
- This plugin's slug is `correct-text-domain`, but the current Text Domain is `wrong-text-domain`. Change the current Text Domain so it is equal to this plugin's slug, and modify the text domain in all your source files. This change is **needed**. Please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#text-domains).
- This plugin's **"Requires at least"** is below 4.6. so you need to set a Text Domain in **main-plugin-file.php**, and it needs to be `correct-text-domain` to correctly internationalize this plugin! Please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#text-domains).
- **"Requires at least"** (x.y) is below 4.6 so a `load_plugin_textdomain` is **needed**, please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#loading-text-domain).
- You must add your Text domain as an argument to every `__()`, `_e()` and `__n()` gettext call, or your translations won’t work.
- If strings in your plugin are also used in WordPress core (e.g. **‘Settings’**), you should still add your own text domain to them. Otherwise, they’ll become untranslated if the core string changes (which happens). Please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#add-text-domain-to-strings).
- Suppose strings in your plugin are also used in WordPress core (e.g., **"Settings"**), you should still add your text domain. Otherwise, they’ll become untranslated if the core string changes (which happens). Please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#add-text-domain-to-strings).
- If your codes have multiple placeholders in a string, please use [argument swapping](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sprintf.php#example-4829).
- **"Plugin name"** is its plugin name, but it has a precise meaning when this string shows on the WordPress Dashboard. In some languages, like zh_TW, the translators don't translate the plugin's name but need to translate the plugin's UI strings, so I made some modifications for this issue.
- For security reason, change `<?php _e(` to `<?php esc_html_e(`. Please refer to [this official article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/security/).
