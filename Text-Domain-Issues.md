# Text Domain 相關問題
多數的 WordPress 外掛，國際化程式碼會出現的問題，多半與 Text Domain 相關。
- This plugin's slug is `correct-text-domain`, but the current Text Domain is `wrong-text-domain`. Change the current Text Domain so it is equal to this plugin's slug and modify the text domain in all your source files. This change is **needed**, please refer to [this article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#text-domains).
- This plugin's **"Requires at least"** is below 4.6. so you need to set a Text Domain in **plugin.php** and it needs to be `social-profiles-widget` to correctly internationalize this plugin! Please refer to [this article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#text-domains).
- **"Requires at least"** (x.y) is below 4.6 so a `load_plugin_textdomain` is **needed**, please refer to [this article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#loading-text-domain).
- You must add your Text domain as an argument to every `__()`, `_e()` and `__n()` gettext call, or your translations won’t work. If there are strings in your plugin that are also used in WordPress core (e.g. **‘Settings’**), you should still add your own text domain to them, otherwise they’ll become untranslated if the core string changes (which happens). Please refer to [this article](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#add-text-domain-to-strings).
